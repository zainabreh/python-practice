Hey, my name is zainab rehman
I'm undergraduate student,
Recently learning Programming in order to become
a successfull women and finanically independent individual.
It's so frustrating and difficult to always studying and
if you'r wasting time while it's not called wasting time,
but giving some time to yourself and thinking that zainab
someone else is studting in your place he/she will go ahead of
and because of that you'r unable to enjoy the time that you have
given to yourself.

AHHHH!!!! iwish i could also become a carefree person like a child.
