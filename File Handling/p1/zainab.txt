Zainab is a good girl and she is always working hard to make her parents proud and less their burden and she believe that that day is not far when she will share her father burden with herself inshaAllah
Rehman is zainab's father, she love her father more than anyone but can't tell to anyone nor she want anyone to know that,she want her  love for her father to be proven by her action not by her words
